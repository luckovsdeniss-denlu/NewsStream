# NewsStream

Android app skeleton (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3).

Video playback, news articles and topics/categories have been removed; the app currently shows an empty home screen.

## Build
CI builds a debug APK on every push (see `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`).
Locally: open in Android Studio, or run `gradle :app:assembleDebug`.

## Versioning
Every push to `main` gets a new version automatically: CI builds `versionName = 0.1.<run number>` and
`versionCode = <run number>`, and uploads `NewsStream-0.1.<run number>.apk`. To bump major/minor, change
`baseVersion` in `app/build.gradle.kts` and the `0.1` prefix in the workflow.

## Roadmap
- Decide on new content and features
